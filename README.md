#  Java Spring REST API

Our goal is to create a REST API where we can add the courses and grades of a student named Alex, and calculate the total GPA for each course of Alex.
While creating this API, we should adhere to error handling and validation rules.
We must comply with Dependency Injection principles.
A basic program has been written using SpringBoot.
